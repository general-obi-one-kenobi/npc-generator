# Welcome to [Alien NPC Generator](https://github.com/general-obi-one-kenobi/npc-generator/blob/main/main.py) by [general-obi-one-kenobi](https://github.com/general-obi-one-kenobi/npc-generator/tree/ma)

## Highlights
1. Generates 10 alien non-player characters (NPCs) for a video game
2. You can set certain attributes to only be within a certain range (ðŸ˜„Yay, options!ðŸ˜„)
3. Creates interesting names
4. Here's a snippet of my code:
   ```python
   first_letter = input('Enter the first letter of the names of your aliens here (Leave blank for a random starting letter): ')
   last_letter = input('Enter the last letter of the names of your aliens here: ')
   min_age = input('Enter a minimum age in years here (leave blank for a random minimum age): ')
   max_age = input('Enter a maximum age in years here (leave blank for a random maximum age): ')
   age = 0
   min_stamina = input('Enter a minimum stamina level here (leave blank for a random minimum stamina level): ')
   max_stamina = input('Enter a maximum stamina level here (leave blank for a random maximum stamina level): ')
   stamina = 0
   min_health = input('Enter a minimum health here (leave blank for a random minimum health): ')
   max_health = input('Enter a maximum health here (leave blank for a random maximum health): ')
   health = 0
   min_power = input('Enter a minimum power level here (leave blank for a random minimum power level): ')
   max_power = input('Enter a maximum power level here (leave blank for a random maximum power level): ')
   power = 0```

## Overview
I am a computer science student and I am still learning how to code in Python. This program can be used to create very basic alien NPCs. The attributes are basic, and other programs display more attributes and give the user more control over said attributes. There are far better programs elsewhere on GitHub, but I still made this so that I could practice using Python and because I needed to do this for a school project. This program generates **10 alien NPCs**, with **names**, **ages**, **stamina levels**, **base health levels**, and **power levels**. The names are **mostly random**, but you can **select the first and last letters** that will be used in all 10 names. You also have the option to **leave them blank**, which makes each name **completely random**. The other attributes all have a **range** that you can enter. The age is a **float** while the others are **integers**. If the minimum value input for a range is higher than the maximum value input, it will give you an error message and output a totally random value instead.  After that, the program prints the values for the attributes in a somewhat orderly fashion.
